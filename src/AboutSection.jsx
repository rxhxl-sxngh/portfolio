                I'm a driven senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
                Computer Science at Texas A&M University, combining academic
                excellence with hands-on industry experience. My career
                aspirations center on becoming an innovative software
                engineer, with particular emphasis on developing scalable
                systems and advancing the field of machine learning.

                Through my role as a teaching assistant during my time at
                A&M, I've deepened my technical understanding of important
                concepts such as Data Structures and algorithms while
                developing strong instructional capabilities, helping fellow
                students grasp complex programming concepts. This has also
                allowed me to become exceedingly comfortable with my
                favorite programming language - C++. ðŸ˜Š

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                My professional experience includes working as an AI/ML
                engineer at NTT Data Corporation, where I've contributed to
                real-world projects and gained valuable industry insights.
                I'm also a Co-Founder at Quaternion Studios, an independent
                agency specializing in building software for 2D/3D modeling
                within the web graphics sector.

                Originally from Houston and now residing in Dallas, I
                maintain a well-rounded lifestyle outside of technology. I'm
                an avid photographer and enjoy water skiing during my
                leisure time. I am a huge Dallas Mavericks fan and if you
                want to ruin my day, mention the Luka trade. My passion for
                exploring different cultures is reflected in my extensive
                travel experiences across multiple countries, broadening my
                worldview and enhancing my ability to work effectively in
                diverse, global environments. I sincerely hope I can
                contribute at least five more countries to "Countries I've
                Visited" list on the right before the end of 2025.
